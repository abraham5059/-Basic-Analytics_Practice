# (Basic) Wealth Ineqiality Analytics
### A basic scope of an entry level data analysis and general practice regarding my technical computer/ program skills.

#### The data being used is fictional and out of my own creation about wealth inequality in a fictional city.

### Synopsis : 
The purpose of this basic/fictional wealth inequality data project is to utilize KPI's to determine which areas of the 
fictional city of "Avalon City" need to be addressed when reporting to governmental or buisness objectives. 

### Data Soruces:
The primary data source is the Avalon City Wealth Inequlaity Spreadsheet 2025 ( a Mac Numbers file) that has been 
converted to .xlsx for wider computer accessibility. 

### Tools
- Mac Numbers - Spreadsheet Development
- Microsoft Excel - Data Conversion & data cleaning
- Tableau - Data Visualization
- Microsoft Excel - Reporting
- Mac Keynote - Presentation
- Microsoft Excel - Presentaion & Analysis Conversion

### Spreadsheet Data Development:

I created fictional districts within "Avalon City" to demonstrate the economic and wealth diverity of the city. Some 
KPI's that are featured in the basic spreadsheet are generally used for reporting and determining real life statistical
information such as Gini Coefficent, Human Development Index & GDP. These districts can also be used to map geographic
visualuzations to better determine wealth gaps in areas of the city.

After creating, filling-in and formatting the data, I then proceeded to convert the numbers file into xlsx. The results
are shown below:

As you can see, there is a bit that was lost in translation and some editing/ cleaning needs to be done. futhermore, I've 
added some higher end detailing and fomratting to futher enhance the spreadsheet. The following image feautres these
translation corrections, appropriate cell formatting as well as spreadsheet enchancements;

Next, the fixed spreadsheet can provide some data analyis insights by filtering and applying basic formulas by using
the Microsoft Excel functions such as:

- Highest district of inequality according to Gini Coef. :

- Lowest district of inequality according to Gini Coef. :
