# (Basic) Wealth Ineqiality Analytics
### A basic scope of an entry level data analysis and general practice regarding my technical computer/ program skills.

#### The data being used is fictional and out of my own creation about wealth inequality in a fictional city.

### Synopsis : 
The purpose of this basic/fictional wealth inequality data project is to utilize KPI's to determine which areas of the 
fictional city of "Avalon City" need to be addressed when reporting to governmental or buisness objectives. 

### Data Soruces:
The primary data source is the Avalon City Wealth Inequlaity Spreadsheet 2025 ( a Mac Numbers file) that has been 
converted to .xlsx for wider computer accessibility. 

### Tools
- Mac Numbers - Spreadsheet Development
- Microsoft Excel - Data Conversion & Data cleaning
- Microsoft Excel - Reporting
- Tableau - Data Visualization & Dashboard
- Mac Keynote - Presentation
- Microsoft Excel - Presentaion & Analysis Conversion

### Spreadsheet Data Development:

I created fictional districts within "Avalon City" to demonstrate the economic and wealth diverity of the city. Some 
KPI's that are featured in the basic spreadsheet are generally used for reporting and determining real life statistical
information such as Gini Coefficent, Human Development Index & GDP. These districts can also be used to map geographic
visualuzations to better determine wealth gaps in areas of the city.

### Data Conversion & Data Cleaning:


After creating, filling-in and formatting the data, I then proceeded to convert the numbers file into xlsx. The results
are shown below:

As you can see, there is a bit that was lost in translation and some editing/ cleaning needs to be done. futhermore, I've 
added some higher end detailing and formatting to futher enhance the spreadsheet. The following image feautres these
translation corrections, appropriate cell formatting as well as spreadsheet enchancements;

#### Reporting:


Next,the cleaned spreadsheet can provide some reporting insights by filtering and applying basic formulas by using
the Microsoft Excel functions such as:

- featuring average counters for related metrics to measure analysis such as " Average GDP in ₳" , "Average Gini Coef."
  and Average HDI which is broken down by the following excel formulations:

  <img width="1106" height="559" alt="averages for Avalon City Wealth Inequlaity Spreadsheet" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb694189-38b7-4267-9fb6-37ca9da6f49d" />


  
  `=AVERAGE(C3:C15)` to produce the Average in GDP result of ₳697,341 for the given data
  `=AVERAGE(H3:H15)` to produce the Average Gini Coef. result of 33.1 for the given data
  `=AVERAGE(F3:F15)` to produce the Average Human Development Index result of 0.890 for Avalon city.

Then we can also filter the data to figure out which districts are on either end of inequality by using the Gini Coef. metric.


- Highest district of inequality according to Gini Coef. :

- Lowest district of inequality according to Gini Coef. :
  <img width="1137" height="429" alt="Lowest Inequality" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccd259e1-72e4-4318-9deb-4e47cd64169d" />


Both of thoese results can also be calculated outby the following excel XLOOKUP formaulations:



  `=XLOOKUP(MAX(H3:H15),A3:H15,1,FALSE)` for which North Avalon is the district with the highest level of inequality.
  `=XLOOKUP(MIN(H3:H15),A3:H15,1,FALSE)` for which Ridge is the district with the lowest level of inequality.


Which results in the following XLOOKUP feauture in the spreasheet:

### Spreadsheet Data Vizualization & Dashboard

After developing and applying light analysis/ reporting (Such as data filtering, excel formulations & conditional formatting)
I then proceed towards the next step of the data analysis which is visualization. This helps visualize the data and lets 
the data convey what the information is without bias. 




  
- 1st, we import the final Microsfot Excel Spredsheet into Tableau Public.

  We check to makure sure the data imported sucessfuly by reviewing the spreasheet in the preview pane making sure there
  are no anomalies that will disrupt the visualization later on when reproting the data. After clicking "Cleaned with
  Data Interpreter", the spreadsheet is automatically and correctly interpreted with the headings and columns appropreatly
  assigned.

- 2nd, we then proceed with Tableau Public's visualization tools by using KPI's to determine the data's story and relative
  information we need to conduct a basic analysis in the form of a dashboard.
